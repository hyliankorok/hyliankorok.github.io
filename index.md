        <p>I've learned about HTML and CSS and all the basic tags within those two languages. I'm getting better and better for each day, and hope to one day make a living out of this, while travelling aroung, learning to surf. This Khan Academy lesson is my first step of many, and I hope it will bear fruits in the oncoming months/years. </p>

        Im going to continue to learn, by watching tutorials and signing up for courses. I'm also going to create my own blog via Wordpress or something of the like, to keep track of my progress in this journey. Eventually, I will try to get some small contracts, quit my job, buy a vehicle, decorate it, and travel around, living the slow life for an unforseeable future. If I fail, I still have other skills which I can use to get a job. But I think it's worth a try.
